We had a Gyoza Party on Hinode Campus. 
Lab members made dumplings and gyoza by hand, which are traditional foods in both Japan and China.

We prepared the fillings and wrapping them. Finally we cooked them by boiling and pan-frying.
(However, t is found not allowed to pan-frying in open space)

All members enjoyed the party and the food made by themselves.

We are looking forward to the party for next year, with more new members!
