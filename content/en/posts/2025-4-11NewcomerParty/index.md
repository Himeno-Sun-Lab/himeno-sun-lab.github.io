We had a party to welcome our newcomers, who will start their new research career in Himeno-Sun Lab.

Prof. Himeno and Prof. Sun introduced newcomers to the lab. Then newcomers and senior members in lab had a brief self introduction in turn.
Our lab staff attended the party as well.
Everyone enjoyed the party and all spent a nice night together.

Special thanks to Yoshimitsu-san, our secretary, for helping preparing this party and other office transactions.
