### Gait Measurement and Data Analysis
This project aims to measure human gait patterns using various sensors and analyze the data to assess health status and motor functions. The research is expected to provide new insights in the fields of rehabilitation and sports science.

We are conducting research to measure human movements and enhance performance using motion capture supported accelerometers. Additionally, the analysis of the portal installation process is conducted through computers, with a focus on research in baseball with no abnormalities detected.
