  abstract = {The pervasive issue of missing data in biomedical signals poses a significant obstacle to their in-depth analysis and interpretation. Existing completion methods often suffer from the loss of critical signal characteristics during the completion process. To address this challenge, we propose the Diffusion-based Biomedical Signal Completion Framework (DBSCF), a general approach capable of completing various types of biomedical signals. Specifically, DBSCF employs a denoising implicit diffusion model combined with temporal embedding information to progressively reconstruct the missing signal from noise, conditioned on the observed signal segments. In addition, we design a UNet-like denoising model composed of ConvNeXt blocks and multi-head ProbSparse self-attention, which effectively captures temporal features from long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that under scattered missing, block missing, and end missing scenarios, DBSCF consistently outperforms other tensor-based and deep learning-based methods in reconstructing missing segments of electrocardiogram, surface electromyogram, and electroencephalogram signals, thereby highlighting the robustness and broad applicability of the proposed framework. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/Shurun-Wang/DBSCF.}

  keywords = {Knowledge-grounded dialogue system, Knowledge selection, Knowledge graph},
  abstract = {Effective knowledge-grounded dialogue systems rely heavily on accurate knowledge selection. This paper begins with an innovative new perspective that categorizes research on knowledge selection based on when knowledge is selected in relation to response generation: pre-, joint-, and post-selection. Among these, pre-selection is of great interest nowadays because they endeavor to provide sufficiently relevant knowledge inputs for downstream response generation models in advance. This reduces the burden of learning, adjusting, and interpreting for the subsequent response generation models, particularly for Large Language Models. Current knowledge pre-selection methods, however, still face three significant challenges: how to cope with different types of knowledge, adapt to the various knowledge requirements in different dialogue contexts, and adapt to different generation models. To resolve the above challenges, we propose ASK, an adaptive knowledge pre-selection method. It unifies various types of knowledge, scores their relevance and contribution to generating desired responses, and adapts the knowledge pool size to ensure the optimal amount is available for generation models. ASK is enhanced by leveraging rewards for selecting appropriate knowledge in both quality and quantity, through a reinforcement learning framework. We perform exhaustive experiments on two benchmarks (WoW and OpenDialKG) and get the following conclusions: 1) ASK has excellent knowledge selection capabilities on diverse knowledge types and requirements. 2) ASK significantly enhances the performance of various downstream generation models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4o. 3) The lightweight improvement of ASK saves 40 % of the computational consumption.
